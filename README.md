ULI Custom Workflow
=====

A ULI is a unique login-link, it looks like /user/reset/1/123/ABC/login and it is generated when you forget your password or using `drush uli`.

This module allows you to use a ULI if you are already logged in; as well as customize the message which is displayed when you follow the ULI link, which can be done in two new fields near the bottom of /admin/config/people/accounts (defaults are "You have successfully logged in." and "You are already logged in.").

Without this module, Drupal assumes that:

* ULIs will not be used if you are already logged in, which is why [you will see an acces denied message if you try that](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3316655);
* ULIs will not be used if you just want to log in your site if you're a normal user, which is why [the message after using the link asks you to reset your password](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2969406).

In certain cases, for example if you are using the [Multiaccess](https://www.drupal.org/project/multiaccess) module, or if you simply request a ULI using the "forgot password" link, without ever having the intention of setting or remembering your password, Drupal's assumptions may not fit your workflow, in which case this module may be for you.

Local development
-----

If you install Docker on your computer:

* you can set up a complete local development workspace by downloading this codebase and running `./scripts/deploy.sh 9` or `./scripts/deploy.sh 10`. You do not need a separate Drupal instance. `./scripts/uli.sh` will provide you with a login link to your environment.
* you can destroy your local environment by running `./scripts/destroy.sh`.
* you can run all tests by running `./scripts/ci.sh`; please make sure all tests before submitting a patch.

Automated testing
-----

This module's main page is on [Drupal.org](http://drupal.org/project/uli_custom_workflow); a mirror is kept on [GitHub](http://github.com/dcycle/uli_custom_workflow).

Tests are performed on the GitHub code using CircleCI.

* [Test results on CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/dcycle/uli_custom_workflow)

To run automated tests locally, install Docker and type:

    ./scripts/ci.sh
